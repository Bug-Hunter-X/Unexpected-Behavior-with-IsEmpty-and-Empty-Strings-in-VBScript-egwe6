This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript related to the misuse of the `IsEmpty` function. The `IsEmpty` function returns `True` if a variable is uninitialized or contains an empty string. This ambiguity can lead to errors in handling optional parameters or empty values.

The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code where an empty string is treated the same as an uninitialized variable, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version utilizing a more explicit check for empty strings, avoiding ambiguity and ensuring correct functionality.
